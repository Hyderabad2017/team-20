Welcome to the Team-20!

Hello, I'd like to suggest that we better use the following tech stack to develop our solution during the CFG-HYD 2017 -
* Firebase from Google as it provides a lot of features right from database and storage to Push notifications to Android and iOS apps using triggers on the database and storage.
* Google Material Design Lite - [Google MDL](https://getmdl.io/) - for the front end development which provides us with a wide set of components, styles, and layouts to use in our solution, so that we __don't waste much time__ in designing the web pages right from scratch.

Kindly put forward your ideas and suggestions ...
