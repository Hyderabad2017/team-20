Welcome to the Team-20!

Hello, I'd like to suggest that we better use the following tech stack to develop our solution during the CFG-HYD 2017 -
* Firebase from Google as it provides a lot of features right from database and storage to Push notifications to Android and iOS apps using triggers on the database and storage.
* Google Material Design Lite - [Google MDL](https://getmdl.io/) - for the front end development which provides us with a wide set of components, styles, and layouts to use in our solution, so that we __don't waste much time__ in designing the web pages right from scratch.

Hi! There everyone.
* I echo Dattamber's thoughts on using Google's Material Design framework, I think the UI looks minimalistic and simple but elegant. It will surely save a lot of time which we could waste trying to find appropriate layouts and styles.
* Coming to Firebase, I am only familiar with Firebase from storage front. It would be great if there is another member in the team who also understands it. Dattamber, if you think it will simplify our work, Iâ€™m all for it and we could perhaps share our work with respect to technologies one is familiar with.

Hello! Even I agree with the thought of using Google MDL, as it saves a lot of time and I feel it will be better if we share our work with respect to our skill sets, then decide and stick to the design flow once we choose a problem statement, as the requirements may change from one problem to another.

* @Arshad I'm good with the concepts of Firebase so I can assist you in using it. Mate, what are you good at ? Android or Web ?
* Firebase is used for rapid development, rather say, prototyping which we'll be doing tomorrow. So, here's a link to the docs from Google - [Reading and writing to database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write) - If we stick to this, then we are ready to develop solutions for Android and Web with some really good features.
* @Saiyana .. web or android ?
